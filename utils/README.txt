Having installed the pipenv ("pipenv install") and activated it's virtual
environment ("pipenv shell"), from this directory (folkfriend/utils/) run the
command "pip install -e ." to install the utils module.

(To avoid issues resolving links to network mounted paths, for PyCharm IDE
 "folkfriend/utils/" can also be added to the pipenv path so code inspection
 points to the right place.)
