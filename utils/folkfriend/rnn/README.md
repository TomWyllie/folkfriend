# Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for End-to-End Text Recognize - TensorFlow 2

This is a re-implementation of the [CRNN](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7801919) network, build by TensorFlow 2. This repository may help you to understand how to build an end-to-end text recognition network easily. By the way, here is the official [repo](https://github.com/bgshih/crnn) implemented by bgshih.
